                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Orientation and viability</p>
                    <p>This project is oriented to the public in general, it can be for domestic use and for industrial use. If it is viable because the pieces can be found in Peru and anywhere in South America. At home you can portray an object on your computer to have it and print it some day, in the industrial area it can be used to scan a missing piece of equipment.</p>

                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Social Impact of the Project</p>
                    <p>This project has a national impact and because not to say that it has a global impact, because both companies, industries and people in general want to print in 3D an object that we already have in physics and the fact of making a sketch in 3D programs is very slow, This product helps you reduce time and copy the object in 3D to your computer with a better quality than you would have done if you had modeled it on your computer.</p>

                <div class="think__details__extra">
                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Economic Impact of the Project</p>
                    <p>According to our research, the prices of 3D scanners are very high, although some are of a small size. Our project has a base cost of approximately 200 soles. The minimum cost investigated was 150 dollars, if we put to think the cheapening that makes the company with respect to our materials, this could generate a profits of client for our project.</p>

                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Use of the laser cutter</p>
                    <p>The additional element to be used in my project will be the use of the laser cutter "Laser Gcc MG 380 Hybrid", to make the box that will contain the scanner for a better quality of scanning.</p>

                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Electronic part of the project</p>
                    <p>For our project we will use electronic parts such as a controller and the well known Arduino Uno (Basic). We will carry out the connection and the programming of the pieces for the respective calibration of the scanner.
                    <br>
                    The project is purely electronic and computerized, the only mechanical part would be the scanner box that will also be cut to size by a laser cutting machine.</p>

                <div class="think__details__extra">
                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Potential customers</p>
                    <p>As mentioned earlier, the potential customers are people in general. If we talk about industrial and business we could include hospitals, recreational centers, lumber industries, mining, it could be useful to replicate materials and have their 3D scanning in the future for other uses or replacements.</p>
                    As we can see, we chose the Goyoneche hospital as an example among all the hospitals, because here it has prothesis that have a high cost and with the scanning and future 3D printing it would reduce its cost of production and obtaining, which would help many families of Peru.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Cerro Verde mining is one of the most important in Peru, here you can use the 3D scanner to replicate and future print plastic parts of their engines such as plastic rings that go between mechanical seals.
